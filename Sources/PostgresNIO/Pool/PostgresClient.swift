/// use to modify the client's behavior.

/// ## Running a client
///
/// ``PostgresClient`` relies on structured concurrency. Because of this it needs a task in which it can schedule all the
/// background work that it needs to do in order to manage connections on the users behave. For this reason, developers
/// must provide a task to the client by scheduling the client's run method in a long running task:
///
/// @Snippet(path: "postgres-nio/Snippets/PostgresClient", slice: "run")
///
/// ``PostgresClient`` can not lease connections, if its ``run()`` method isn't active. Cancelling the ``run()`` method
/// is equivalent to closing the client. Once a client's ``run()`` method has been cancelled, executing queries or prepared
/// statements will fail.
